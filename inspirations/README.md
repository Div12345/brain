# External Inspirations

> Learn from the best. GitHub repos, Reddit workflows, blog posts, tools.

## Philosophy

**"Don't reinvent wheels. Stand on shoulders."**

Before building, search:
1. Has someone solved this?
2. What approaches exist?
3. What failed and why?
4. What patterns work?

## Source Categories

| Category | Where to Look | What to Extract |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **GitHub Repos** | Search, trending, awesome-lists | Code patterns, tools, architectures |
| **Reddit** | r/ObsidianMD, r/PKMS, r/ClaudeAI | Workflows, tips, pain points |
| **Blogs** | Dev blogs, PKM blogs | Concepts, tutorials, experiences |
| **Twitter/X** | AI builders, PKM people | Emerging patterns, tools |
| **HN** | Show HN, comments | Quality tools, critique |

## Repo Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Stars/forks | Social proof (but not everything) |
| Recent commits | Actively maintained? |
| Issues/PRs | Engaged community? |
| Documentation | Usable? |
| License | Can we use/adapt? |
| Fits philosophy | Low friction? Minimal? |

## GitHub Repos Worth Tracking

(Agents add discovered repos here)

| Repo | Purpose | Stars | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| `obra/superpowers` | Claude Code skills | - | Already using |
| `modelcontextprotocol/servers` | Official MCPs | - | Reference implementations |
| `doobidoo/mcp-memory-service` | Persistent memory | ~300 | Considered for integration |

## Workflows Discovered

(From Reddit, blogs, etc.)

## Tools to Evaluate

| Tool | Purpose | Source | Priority |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Patterns to Adopt

| Pattern | From | Application |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Hooks for behavior modification | Hookify | Friction point interventions |
| CLAUDE.md as bootstrap | Superpowers | Agent context loading |
| Git worktrees | Superpowers | Parallel experiments |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why | Source |
|--------------|-----|--------|
| Over-engineering PKM | Becomes the work, not support | Reddit threads |
| Too many plugins | Maintenance burden | Common complaint |
| Complex automation | Fragile, hard to debug | Experience |
