# VAULT RESTRUCTURE: START HERE

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Design Complete → Ready for Phase 3 Implementation
**Your Next Action:** Read this document (5 min), then choose your path

---

## What Happened (Phases 1-2)

The vault system has been completely analyzed and redesigned.

**Evidence:**
- ✓ Deep audit of all project structures (Phase 1)
- ✓ Unified architecture designed (Phase 2)
- ✓ Cooking consolidation proved the pattern works (58 notes → 1 Command Center)
- ✓ Overnight inbox analysis identified patterns and gems (15,000 words)
- ✓ 4 comprehensive design documents created

**Result:** You now have a complete blueprint for the unified vault system.

---

## What You Need To Read

### If you have 30 minutes:
**Read in this order:**

1. **meta/ARCHITECT SUMMARY** (10 min)
   - Quick overview of what was designed
   - Why the architecture works
   - What's ready for execution

2. **meta/Vault Rules.md** (20 min)
   - The complete system rules
   - Where things go
   - Why they go there

**Then:** Pick one Command Center to create (phd or brain system recommended)

### If you have 10 minutes:
**Just read:**
- This document (5 min)
- Dashboard/Focus.md (5 min)

**Then:** Pick your next action from Focus.md

### If you have 60 minutes:
**Read everything in order:**
1. meta/ARCHITECT SUMMARY (10 min)
2. meta/Vault Rules.md (20 min)
3. Dashboard/Focus.md (10 min)
4. meta/Vault Restructure Implementation Guide.md (20 min)

**Then:** Start Phase 3 immediately (create first Command Center)

## The Four New Documents

| Document | Purpose | Read Time | Length |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **meta/ARCHITECT SUMMARY** | Why this design works | 10 min | 2,000 words |
| **meta/Vault Rules.md** | How the system works | 20 min | 4,200 words |
| **Dashboard/Focus.md** | What to work on now | 10 min | 2,800 words |
| **meta/Implementation Guide.md** | How to execute phases 3-6 | 20 min | 3,500 words |

**Total commitment:** 60 minutes of reading = ready to execute entire restructure

## The Three Systems (30-Second Version)

### Projects (Goal-Oriented)
- Have beginnings and ends
- Examples: arterial analysis, cooking, PhD, cardiac output, room redesign
- Each has: Command Center.md + sessions/ folder
- Used for: Project-specific work

### Knowledge (Concept-Oriented)
- Reusable across projects
- Evergreen and outlasts projects
- Examples: stability-selection, compound-engineering, ai-memory-systems
- Rule: One clear idea, 2+ links, proper tags

### Meta (System Operations)
- How the vault itself works
- Examples: Vault Rules.md, Focus.md, templates
- Replaceable and versionable
- Used for: Navigation and system thinking

---

## Your Next Steps

### Option A: "I want to understand the system" (60 min)
→ Read all 4 documents above
→ Then start Phase 3 with full context

### Option B: "I want to start immediately" (30 min)
→ Read ARCHITECT SUMMARY + Vault Rules.md
→ Then follow Implementation Guide for Phase 3

### Option C: "Just tell me what to do" (10 min)
→ Read Focus.md
→ Pick first action from Focus.md
→ Refer to Implementation Guide as needed

## What's Ready Right Now

**Templates are ready to use:**
- Projects/phd/Command Center.md template (in Implementation Guide)
- Projects/cardiac output estimation/Command Center.md template
- Projects/room redesign/Command Center.md template
- Projects/brain system/Command Center.md template

**Gems to move are identified:**
1. interpretable machine learning.md → Projects/arterial analysis/
2. medical ML interpretability.md → Projects/arterial analysis/
3. Feb 19 results with comments.md → Projects/arterial analysis/data-results/
4. Compound Engineering article → Projects/brain system/
5. literature review note → Projects/arterial analysis/sessions/

**Inbox processing is planned:**
- 29 notes already moved
- ~150 remaining notes have clear instructions
- Overnight analysis shows exactly where each should go

---

## Timeline

**Phase 3 (Implement Structure):** 3 days
- Create 4 Command Centers
- Move 5 gem notes
- Standardize folder structures

**Phase 4 (Build Dashboard):** 3-4 hours (agent work)
- Enhance Dashboard/Focus.md
- Create graph analysis
- Build weekly review template

**Phase 5 (Update Docs):** 2-3 hours (agent work)
- Update HOME.md, ACTIVE.md, CLAUDE.md
- Create system operations handbook
- Archive deprecated docs

**Phase 6 (Verification):** 2 hours (architect work)
- Check all structures complete
- Verify no broken links
- Document learnings

**Total:** ~1 week to complete restructure, ready by ~2026-02-17

## Key Insights from Design

**Why this works:**
- **Cooking consolidation proves it** - 58 notes → 1 doc is much better
- **Overnight analysis validates patterns** - Same structure applies everywhere
- **Compound Engineering loop drives improvement** - Each phase makes next easier
- **Documentation is complete** - Rules explain exceptions and edge cases

**Why it's better than old system:**
- **One source of truth per project** (Command Center) vs scattered notes
- **Clear Projects/Knowledge distinction** vs everything mixed together
- **Unified rules** (Vault Rules.md) vs scattered guidelines
- **Single dashboard** (Focus.md) vs reading multiple state files

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to follow these rules exactly?**
A: No. The rules document exceptions and edge cases. When you hit something that doesn't fit, check the FAQ section in Vault Rules.md.

**Q: Can I change the system if I don't like it?**
A: Yes. This is v2.0, not final. If Phase 3 implementation reveals issues, adjust and document the change. The Compound Engineering loop supports iteration.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Check Dashboard/Focus.md first (it might already have the answer). Then check Vault Rules.md for the relevant rule. Then check Implementation Guide for step-by-step instructions.

**Q: Do I need to create all 6 Command Centers?**
A: Start with phd + brain system (highest priority). The other 3 can follow within days. Cooking already has one.

**Q: What happens to my Inbox notes?**
A: Overnight analysis showed exactly where 29 should go. For remaining 150, the analysis provides clear patterns. Implementation Guide explains the processing order.

## Key Contacts & Escalation

**If you get stuck:**
1. Check this document (VAULT RESTRUCTURE - START HERE.md)
2. Check Dashboard/Focus.md
3. Check Vault Rules.md for relevant rule
4. Check Implementation Guide for detailed steps
5. If still unclear, create session note with the question

**For agent questions:**
- Check Vault Rules.md (system boundaries)
- Check Implementation Guide (execution steps)
- Reference cooking Command Center (working example)

---

## What's Actually Changed

**You can start using the system immediately:**
- ✓ Vault Rules.md is ready
- ✓ Focus.md is ready
- ✓ Templates are ready
- ✓ Recommendations are ready
- ✓ Project structure is proven (cooking works)

**You don't have to wait for anything:**
- There are no blockers
- All knowledge is documented
- All patterns are validated
- You can start Phase 3 whenever ready

---

## One More Thing

**This vault restructure is itself a compound engineering project:**

- **Phase 1-2 (Work):** Audit and design
- **Phase 3-5 (Assess):** Implement and verify
- **Phase 6 (Compound):** Document learnings in `docs/solutions/`

Each phase makes the next easier:
- Audit revealed patterns → Design could be thorough
- Design was complete → Implementation has templates
- Implementation will be clean → Compound step will have clear story
- Learnings will be documented → Next system iteration will be faster

**This isn't just restructuring. This is the system improving itself.**

---

## Start Now

**Pick one:**
- [ ] Read ARCHITECT SUMMARY (10 min start)
- [ ] Read Vault Rules.md (20 min start)
- [ ] Read Focus.md (5 min start)
- [ ] Create Projects/phd/Command Center.md (30 min start)
- [ ] Process Inbox using overnight analysis (20 min start)

**Recommendation:** Start with ARCHITECT SUMMARY + Vault Rules.md. You'll be ready to execute everything after that.
