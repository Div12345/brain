I will retrieve the full text of the paper with Zotero key `C7958NR2` to extract the required information.
Error executing tool zotero_get_item_fulltext: Tool execution denied by policy.
I will read the local markdown file `papers/C7958NR2.md` since the Zotero tool was denied.
I will try to read the content of `papers/C7958NR2.md` again using `cat`, as the previous `read_file` attempt returned unexpected output.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "search_pubmed", "search_iacr"?
I will attempt to read `papers/C7958NR2.md` using the `read_file` tool again, verifying the content this time.
I will use `search_file_content` to search for "Introduction" in `papers/C7958NR2.md` and request 100 lines of context to retrieve a significant portion of the paper's text.
