I will read the local file `papers/A84M8FI4.md` since the Zotero tool access was denied, assuming the content is mirrored there.

I will attempt to read `papers/A84M8FI4.md` again and also read `extraction-template.md` to verify the tool's functionality, as the previous output appeared to be system logs rather than file content.
I will search for the paper "Cheng 2013 central blood pressure thresholds" using Google Scholar to retrieve its full title and abstract, as the local file appears corrupted.
Error executing tool search_google_scholar: Tool execution denied by policy.
I will search for the paper "Derivation and validation of diagnostic thresholds for central blood pressure measurements" using the `search_papers` tool on PubMed to retrieve its details, as `search_google_scholar` was denied.
Error executing tool search_papers: Tool execution denied by policy.

I will use `search_file_content` to search for the phrase "Derivation and validation of diagnostic thresholds" within the current directory to locate the paper's content, as external search tools are restricted.

I will read `papers/F6R5QJ4S.md` to check its content and determine if it contains valid paper data or if it is also corrupted, which will help clarify the state of the files in the directory.
I will read `extract-paper.sh` to understand the intended workflow and check if it contains any instructions or methods for retrieving the paper content.
