# Overnight Cooking Command Center Build
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Agent:** Overnight Vault Worker
**Task:** Consolidate 50+ scattered cooking notes into one living document

---

## What Was Created

### Main Deliverable: `Projects/cooking/Command Center.md`
A comprehensive single-document cooking system that consolidates:
- **47 ingredient notes** - organized by storage location (Fridge, Freezer, Pantry) with shelf life, batches, and usage notes
- **9 recipe/stack notes** - organized by energy level (Zero/Low/Medium/High)
- **2 system notes** - the 5-component framework and dashboard queries

The Command Center is structured as:
1. **Inventory** - What you have, organized by storage (Fridge/Freezer/Pantry)
2. **Meals by Energy Level** - 🔴 Zero (< 5 min), 🟡 Low (< 15 min), 🟢 Medium (15-30 min), 🔵 Project (30+ min)
3. **Shopping Rules** - Always stock, never buy fresh, batch buying, TJ's store map
4. **What I've Learned** - The 5-component system, energy management, carb timing, shelf life strategy, cooking hacks
5. **Stack Reference** - All 9 meal assembly patterns with full details

## Notes With Non-Cooking Content

### NOT MOVED (Mixed Content):
- **`special baking.md`** - Contains cannabis edibles cooking methods (sous weed, instant pot, mason jar oven). Related to `mj.md`. Reddit links to r/SousWeed, r/highvegans, r/AskCulinary. This is NOT traditional cooking - it's about infusing cannabis into butter/oil.
- **`vanilla.md`** - Brief philosophical note: "the plain flavor, the boring one, but dependability for the basicness." This is conceptual/abstract, not a cooking ingredient note.

These two notes were LEFT IN INBOX because they don't fit the cooking ingredient/recipe pattern.

## Observations About the User's Cooking System

### System Design (Brilliant)
- **5-Component Stack Framework:** Every meal = Base + Protein + Veggie + Sauce + Crunch
- **Day/Night Logic:** Day meals are high-carb (rice, naan, bread), Night meals are low-carb (greens, cruciferous crunch, slaw)
- **Energy-Based Meal Planning:** Recipes categorized by how much effort they take, from "Girl Dinner" (zero energy assembly) to "Project Cooking" (weekend meal prep)
- **Batch Tracking:** Each ingredient has a `batches` field logging purchase date and quantity (e.g., "2026-01-18 | 1 pack")
- **Shelf Life Strategy:** Ingredients tagged with shelf life in days, clear awareness of what to use first

### Patterns & Preferences
- **Zhoug is Everything:** Mentioned as "the universal spice driver" and "when in doubt, add Zhoug" - this is THE flavor anchor
- **Cruciferous Crunch Dependency:** This TJ's product powers ALL night bases - appears in 5 different recipes
- **Red Onions:** "Base for EVERYTHING" - appears in almost every recipe, emphasis on never running out
- **Frozen > Fresh Philosophy:** Explicit preference for frozen plantains, cauliflower, potatoes, rice "saves 20 min"
- **Trader Joe's Reliance:** Most ingredients come from TJ's with specific product names (Vegan Kale Pesto, Sriracha Baked Tofu, etc.)
- **Vegetarian/Vegan-Leaning:** All proteins are plant-based or dairy (paneer, tofu, beans, chickpeas) - no meat
- **Indian-Mexican Fusion:** Strong Indian flavors (paneer, chana, tikka, sev, okra) mixed with Mexican format (tacos, wraps)
- **Energy Management is Key:** Recipes explicitly note cooking times and energy required. "Girl Dinner" and "Zombie mode" are real categories.

### Interesting Content
- **"Girl Dinner" Mode:** Zero-energy category with no shame - "Hummus + Naan + cold Tofu (straight from package)" or "Frozen Eclairs (no shame)"
- **Besan (Gram Flour) Hack:** Used to coat okra before air frying for "crispy perfection"
- **Mustard Oil:** For tandoori paneer marinade - Indian store specialty item
- **Shopping List had TJ's Store Map:** Organized by actual store sections (Produce, Frozen, Dairy, Dips, International, Snacks, Baking, Bakery)
- **Batch Purchase Dates:** Latest shopping was 2026-01-18 (ingredients) and 2026-01-19 (sweets) - purchased just 3 weeks ago
- **Sweets Layer:** Cookie dough, chocolate chips, pudding mix, cool whip, mini eclairs - separate sweet category outside the 5-component system

### Voice & Tone
- Casual, no-nonsense, relatable ("Tired AF", "Zombie mode", "Girl Dinner")
- Very practical and anti-perfectionist (frozen > fresh, "no shame" about easy meals)
- Clear frustration-prevention focus: "Edit when you discover or get frustrated"
- Energy-aware and compassionate to low-energy states

## Technical Notes

- All original notes had structured frontmatter with tags, layers, storage, shelf_life, batches, store_section
- The system uses wikilinks [[like this]] to reference ingredients within recipes
- Original "Cooking Dashboard" had dataview queries for dynamic shopping lists and freshness tracking
- Recipes categorized by energy_req (Low/Medium/High) and meal_time (Day/Night)
- The 5 layers in the system: Base, Protein, Veggie, Sauce, Crunch

## Outcome

The user now has ONE living document to reference instead of 58 scattered notes. The Command Center preserves all the detail, adds organization by energy level and storage location, and extracts the user's learned patterns (shopping rules, energy management, shelf life strategy, cooking hacks).

The original notes are safely archived and can be referenced if needed, but the user should never need to go back to them - everything is in the Command Center now.
