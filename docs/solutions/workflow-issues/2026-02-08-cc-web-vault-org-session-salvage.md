# CC Web Session Salvage: Vault Organization (tmux 3)

Session hit 5h limit at 385 minutes while doing Obsidian Inbox triage.

## What the session produced

Categorization recommendations for Inbox notes:

### Move to Projects/arterial analysis/
- arterial analysis ml pipeline code review
- smartwatch for fall detection (sub-project idea)

### Move to Projects/phd/
- PhD annual feedback 2024-25
- phd task board
- January 2025 target setting
- ML mentor networking

### Create new Projects/cooking/
- All ~50 cooking notes (ingredients, stacks, recipes, Cooking Dashboard, Cooking_System)
- This is a coherent system

### Move to Projects/room redesign/
- house organization, small space strategies, cooking in a small space

### Archive
- Housing search 2025 (expired)

### Keep in Inbox (fleeting)
- Cat notes
- Motocamping plans (aspirational)

## Key insight captured

Projects vs Knowledge distinction:
- **Knowledge**: Concepts true across contexts (evergreen, e.g., "Stability Selection")
- **Projects**: Work toward specific goal (has beginning/end, e.g., "arterial analysis pipeline")

Rule to add: Projects link to Knowledge, Knowledge links to Projects.

## Status

Session cannot be rescued (quota exhausted). Recommendations above can be executed manually or in a fresh session.
