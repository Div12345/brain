# Task: Overnight Research & Build Session

## Objective
Continue building out the brain orchestration system with deep research and practical implementations.

## Core Intentionalities (from user)
- Self-evolving AI assistant system
- Learns patterns, anticipates needs
- Builds its own tools when gaps identified
- Scientific experimentation with logging
- Proactively prompts for information
- Never harms existing systems

## Work Streams

### 1. Deep Tool Research
- [ ] Evaluate claude-flow installation and setup requirements
- [ ] Research hookify/hooks for Claude Code
- [ ] Find MCP servers useful for this system
- [ ] Research Obsidian automation tools
- [ ] Find prompt engineering resources for agent definitions

### 2. Build Practical Tools
- [ ] Create overnight agent definition
- [ ] Write CC startup hook draft
- [ ] Create sample task templates
- [ ] Build context file templates

### 3. Pattern Discovery
- [ ] Search Reddit for Claude workflows
- [ ] Find blog posts on autonomous coding
- [ ] Document useful patterns in knowledge/

### 4. System Structure
- [ ] Flesh out agents/ directory
- [ ] Create experiment templates
- [ ] Set up knowledge/patterns/ structure

## Success Criteria
- More actionable configs/templates
- Documented findings in inspirations/
- System more ready for first real overnight run
