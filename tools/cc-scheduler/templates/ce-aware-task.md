## Post-Execution Protocol

After completing the primary task above:

1. **Self-Review** — Re-read your changes. Check against the acceptance criteria listed in the task. If anything is incomplete or wrong, fix it now.
2. **Capture Learnings** — If you solved a non-trivial problem or discovered a gotcha:
   - Write a solution doc to `docs/solutions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (use today's date)
   - Include: category (frontmatter), symptoms, root cause, solution, prevention
3. **Summary** — Write a brief completion summary to stdout covering: what was done, what was learned, what remains (if anything).
