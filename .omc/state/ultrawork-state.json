  "original_prompt": "My need is to have all the command centers available in one place or idk some different capture system but whatever it should be simple for me and the logging pattern of everything should be clean. rn I dont think the projects have a proper structure across all of them proper yet and nor doing well with an easily maintainable system. I should be able to remember all the rules necessary for any step in this process for it to actually be good i think. idk. the interface is not enough for me yet and the confidence that any capture will automatically go correct. with an inbox system it shouldn't matter but then I was struggling with the connections. idk. think well about the system I'm envisioning from my obsidian all the tools stacks outwards and etc. idk. I need the full packaged system properly. I feel like the cooking command center is bs for example, there is no cognitively well structured easy  for me things etc. idk this is not well done or sufficient enough for the levels necessary for my knowledge repo actually I think. and you just picked one thread. the knowledges will connect to projects too, idk, you didn't do a planned enough, thorough enough job. you should maybe do lfg in ultrapilot or something like that idk with ralph even. think well but do NOT destroy my knowledge base. actually how are you going to guarantee that for me?",
