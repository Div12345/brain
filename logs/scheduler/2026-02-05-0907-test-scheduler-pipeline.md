I will verify the scheduler pipeline by asking Claude Desktop a simple math question.

I will create a new conversation in Claude Desktop.

I will ask Claude Desktop "What is 2+2?".

I will read the latest response from Claude Desktop to confirm the answer.

The response from Claude Desktop was:
"Thinking about calculating a basic arithmetic sum... Done 4"

This confirms the calculation of 2+2 equals 4.
