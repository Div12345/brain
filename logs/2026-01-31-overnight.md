# Overnight Session: 2026-01-31 (Extended)

## Duration
Start: ~02:00
Compactions: 08:33, 09:39, 09:41, 09:46
End: ongoing

## Session Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (~02:00-08:33)
- MCP server discovery (1,134+ repos)
- Claude Code ecosystem research
- Initial Obsidian conversion

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Coordination (~09:30-09:46)
- Multi-agent coordination patterns research
- Active-agents tracking system
- Task scheduling research
- Session state for compaction resilience

### Phase 3: Self-Improvement (~09:38-current)
- Recursive self-improvement patterns (Gödel Agent)
- Proactive assistant patterns
- Metrics tracking infrastructure
- Predictions system

## Commits This Session
1. Research: Multi-agent coordination patterns
2. Coordination: Create active-agents tracking file
3. Research: Task automation and scheduling options
4. Task: Scheduled overnight runs setup
5. Research: Recursive self-improvement patterns
6. Self-improvement: Add metrics and retrospective tracking
7. Research: Proactive assistant patterns
8. Proactive: Generate predictions for tomorrow
9. Obsidian: Update ACTIVE.md with current state
10. Obsidian: Update CLAUDE.md with frontmatter
11. Coordination: Update session-state with latest progress
12. Research: PKM MCP servers overview
13. Obsidian: Update HOME.md with new research links

## Research Docs Created
- [[knowledge/research/multi-agent-coordination]]
- [[knowledge/research/task-automation-scheduling]]
- [[knowledge/research/recursive-self-improvement]]
- [[knowledge/research/proactive-assistant-patterns]]
- [[knowledge/research/pkm-mcp-servers]]

## Infrastructure Created
- [[context/active-agents]] - Agent claim tracking
- [[context/self-improvement-metrics]] - Performance tracking
- [[context/predictions]] - Tomorrow's predictions
- [[tasks/pending/task-sched-001]] - Scheduling task

## Patterns Identified
1. **Blackboard coordination** - GitHub commits as broadcast
2. **File-level locking** - Work on different files to avoid conflicts
3. **Session-state recovery** - For compaction resilience
4. **Gödel Agent pattern** - Self-referential improvement

## Pending Questions
- Q-2026-01-31-01: Overnight schedule preference
- Q-2026-01-31-02: Obsidian vault path
- Q-2026-01-31-03: Failed task notification
- Q-2026-01-31-04: Off-limits tasks
- Q-2026-01-31-05: Brain repo local path

## Retrospective (V1 Self-Improvement)

### What Worked
- Blackboard coordination via GitHub commits
- Session-state.md for compaction survival
- Research → knowledge doc → commit cycle
- Frequent commits for visibility

### What Didn't Work
- No good way to handle merge conflicts yet
- Unclear optimal commit frequency
- Some file conversions still pending

### Improvements for Next Session
- Implement commit hooks for validation
- Add conflict detection to active-agents.md
- Complete remaining file conversions
