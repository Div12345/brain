I will now begin the task of obtaining a production-quality email validation function from Claude Desktop. I will follow the specified protocol, iterating up to three times to refine the function. I will track my progress and report the final outcome as requested.
I have started a new conversation with Claude Desktop. Now I will send the first prompt to ask for the email validation function.
It seems there was an error sending the message to Claude Desktop. The error is "Input failed: no-prosemirror". This might be a transient issue with the Claude Desktop application state. I will try sending the message again.
The message was sent successfully this time. I will now read the response from Claude Desktop.
I sent the request, but there are no messages yet. It's possible the response is still being generated. I will wait a moment and check again. I'll use `claude_desktop_status` to see if it's currently generating.
The status shows `is_generating: false` and `message_count: 0`, which is unexpected. It seems my previous `send` command didn't actually result in a message being created in the conversation, despite returning `success: true`. This might be another symptom of the 'no-prosemirror' issue I saw earlier, where the UI isn't in a ready state.

Given the inconsistency, I will try a more robust approach:
1.  Relaunch Claude Desktop to ensure a clean state.
2.  Start a new conversation again.
3.  Send the prompt again.
4.  Check the status to make sure it's generating.
5.  Read the response.

I'll start by relaunching.
Now that Claude Desktop has been relaunched, I will start a new conversation and send the prompt again.
Attempt 1 failed: You have exhausted your capacity on this model. Your quota will reset after 0s.. Retrying after 284.130341ms...
The "no-prosemirror" error occurred again. This indicates a persistent problem with the Claude Desktop application itself, preventing it from receiving input correctly. Since I am unable to send the initial prompt, I cannot proceed with the task.

The experiment has failed due to a technical issue with the target application.

EXPERIMENT_FAILED
TURNS_USED: 2
FINAL_QUALITY: 1
REASONING: The `claude_desktop_send` tool is consistently failing with a "no-prosemirror" error, which prevents me from interacting with Claude Desktop to start the task. Relaunching the application did not resolve the issue.
