EXPERIMENT_FAILED
TURNS_USED: 3
FINAL_QUALITY: 1
REASONING: The task requires the use of `claude_desktop_*` tools (e.g., `claude_desktop_new`, `claude_desktop_send`). However, these tools are not registered in my current environment, as indicated by the error "Tool "claude_desktop_new" not found in registry." Investigation revealed that these functions are part of an MCP server (`tools/mcps/claude-desktop-mcp/server.py`) designed to be consumed by a client like Claude Code, not directly callable by Gemini CLI in this manner. Without access to these specific tools, the task cannot be fulfilled as instructed.
