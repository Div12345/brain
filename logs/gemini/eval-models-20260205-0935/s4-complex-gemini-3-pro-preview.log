I will start a new conversation with Claude Desktop to ensure a clean state.
I will now initialize a new session using the direct tool `claude_desktop_new`.
I will send the prompt asking for a detailed comparison of microservices and monoliths for a small startup, focusing on cost, complexity, team size, and deployment.
I will read the full response from Claude Desktop to check for truncation and ensure I have the complete analysis.
The response was cut off, so I'll ask Claude to pick up where it left off, specifically covering Team Size and Deployment/DevOps.
It looks like the recommendation was cut off again, so I'll ask Claude to finish it, picking up from "genuinely different scaling requiremen".
