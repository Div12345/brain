I will start a new conversation with Claude Desktop and ask it to write a Python email validation function.

I will now send the prompt to Claude Desktop.

The initial implementation is excellent and breaks down validation logic clearly rather than relying on a single complex regex. It covers standard RFC 5321 constraints (lengths, dot placement, allowed characters).

However, the current regex enforces ASCII-only characters (`a-zA-Z0-9...`). Modern standards (RFC 6530) allow internationalized emails (e.g., `user@example.com` or `pelé@example.com`).

I will ask Claude to update the function to support internationalized domain names (IDN) and UTF-8 local parts.
