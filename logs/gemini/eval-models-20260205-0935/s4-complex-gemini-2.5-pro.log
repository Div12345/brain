REASONING: The model provided a comprehensive and well-structured analysis that directly addressed all dimensions in the initial prompt (cost, complexity, team size, deployment). The recommendation to start with a "modular monolith" was excellent, practical, and well-justified. The advice was nuanced and perfectly tailored to the context of a small startup, demonstrating a strong understanding of software architecture trade-offs. No follow-up for shallowness was necessary.
