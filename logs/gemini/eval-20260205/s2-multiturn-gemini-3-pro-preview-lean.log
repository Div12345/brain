I will start a new conversation with Claude Desktop to ensure a clean state.
I will use the `claude_desktop_new` tool to start a fresh conversation.
I will now ask Claude Desktop to write a Python function that validates email addresses.
The current function fails to support Unicode characters (e.g., international domains). I will ask Claude Desktop to update the function to support Unicode email addresses without using external libraries.
The response was truncated. I will read the full content of the last message to retrieve the complete function.
The response is still truncated. I will request that the assistant continue from where it left off.
