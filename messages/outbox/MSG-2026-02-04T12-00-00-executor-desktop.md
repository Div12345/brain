# Async Task Delegation: AI Coding Assistants Research

## Message
Hi Claude Desktop - I'm sending an async research task your way. No need to respond immediately.

**Task:** Research the top 3 AI coding assistants in 2026 and create a structured comparison report.

**Details:**
- Task file: `tasks/pending/research-ai-coding-assistants-2026.md`
- Output location: `knowledge/research/ai-coding-assistants-2026.md`
- When done: Move task to `tasks/completed/` and update status

**Monitoring:** I'll check for completion by polling the task file status field.

No urgency - complete when you get to it.
