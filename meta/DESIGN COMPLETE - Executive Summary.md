# DESIGN COMPLETE: Unified Vault Architecture

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** ✓ ARCHITECTURE DESIGN COMPLETE
**Ready for:** Phase 3 Implementation (user can start immediately)
**Timeline:** 3-5 days to complete full restructure
**Commitment:** ~60 min reading + 3-4 days implementation

---

## What Was Designed

A unified vault system with three distinct but integrated subsystems:

1. **Projects** - Goal-oriented work (arterial analysis, cooking, PhD, etc.)
2. **Knowledge** - Reusable concepts (stability-selection, compound-engineering, etc.)
3. **Meta** - System operations (Vault Rules, Focus, templates, etc.)

Each system has clear boundaries, consistent structure, and specific rules.

---

## Why This Design

**Problem:** 180+ notes scattered across vault with no clear organization
**Solution:** Three systems with different lifecycles
**Proof:** Cooking consolidation (58 notes → 1 Command Center) proves it works

**Key insight:** Projects and Knowledge are fundamentally different:
- Projects have beginnings and ends
- Knowledge is evergreen
- They need different structures and rules

---

## The System Explained (2 Minutes)

**Three systems, different rules:**

1. **Projects** - "Work toward a specific outcome"
   - Cooking, PhD, arterial analysis, cardiac output, room redesign
   - Each has Command Center.md (single source of truth) + sessions/ (decisions)
   - Rule: Keep project work IN projects/, not scattered

2. **Knowledge** - "Concepts true across contexts"
   - Stability-selection, compound-engineering, ai-memory-systems
   - Evergreen, outlasts projects
   - Rule: One clear idea, 2+ links, proper tags

3. **Meta** - "How the system itself works"
   - Vault Rules, Focus, templates
   - Replaceable and versionable
   - Rule: Version as system evolves

**Result:** Clear answer to "where does this note go?"

**Gem notes identified (ready to move):**
1. interpretable machine learning.md → Projects/arterial analysis/
2. medical ML interpretability.md → Projects/arterial analysis/
3. Feb 19 results with comments.md → Projects/arterial analysis/data-results/
4. Compound Engineering article → Projects/brain system/
5. literature review note → Projects/arterial analysis/sessions/

**Inbox processing plan (clear categories):**
- 29 notes already moved
- 5 gem notes above ready to move
- 150 remaining notes have clear instructions
- Archive recommendations provided

**No blockers except:**
- User decision: Personal/ folder for sensitive notes?
- Data blocker: Find "Dr. Hahn outcomes" file
- Time blocker: When can you start?

## Impact Forecast

**User experience improvement:**

Before:
- 180+ Inbox notes (where should they go?)
- 6 projects with scattered notes
- Dashboard/State.md requires reading multiple files
- No clear "single source of truth" per project
- 10-15 min to find project-specific information

After:
- Inbox processed (gems in homes, rest archived)
- 6 projects with Command Centers (single doc per project)
- Dashboard/Focus.md shows all priorities (2-3 min read)
- Every project has one definitive Command Center
- 30 seconds to find any project-specific information

**System improvement:**

- Compound Engineering loop automatically documented
- Learnings feed into next project (lessons carried forward)
- System itself improves with each phase completion
- Future vault restructures will be faster (patterns documented)

## How to Use These Documents

**Working in your vault:**
- Check Vault Rules.md when unsure where something goes
- Check Focus.md at start of each session (know what to do)
- Check Implementation Guide when executing phases
- Check ARCHITECT SUMMARY when understanding rationale
- Check START HERE when navigating the system

**For agents:**
- Read Vault Rules.md to understand boundaries
- Check Focus.md for priorities
- Follow Implementation Guide for execution
- Reference cooking Command Center for examples

**For long-term:**
- Vault Rules.md is the definitive source
- Updates during implementation feed back into Vault Rules.md
- Each phase feeds learnings into docs/solutions/
- Next vault iteration will be faster

## Success Criteria (Phase 6)

When architecture is fully implemented:

- [x] Design complete and documented (this phase)
- [ ] All 6 projects have Command Centers (Phase 3)
- [ ] All Command Centers follow same structure (Phase 3)
- [ ] All projects have sessions/ folders (Phase 3)
- [ ] 5 gem notes moved to project homes (Phase 3)
- [ ] <50 unprocessed Inbox notes (Phase 3)
- [ ] Remaining Inbox notes categorized/archived (Phase 3)
- [ ] Dashboard/Focus.md enhanced (Phase 4)
- [ ] Documentation updated (Phase 5)
- [ ] No broken wikilinks (Phase 6)
- [ ] <20 orphan notes (Phase 6)
- [ ] Architect verification complete (Phase 6)
- [ ] Learnings documented in docs/solutions/ (Phase 6)

---

## The Compound Principle

**This design itself follows Compound Engineering:**

**Work (Phases 1-2):** Audit → Analyze → Design
- Deep analysis of all structures
- Overnight consolidation and categorization
- Complete documentation of findings

**Assess (Phases 3-5):** Implement → Test → Review
- Create Command Centers (proves pattern)
- Move notes to homes (validates categorization)
- Update documentation (captures learnings)

**Compound (Phase 6):** Verify → Document → Extract
- Verify system completeness
- Document solutions in docs/solutions/
- Extract patterns for next iteration

**Result:** Each project makes the next project easier
- Cooking consolidation proved the pattern
- That proof makes phd/cardiac easier to create
- Each success gets documented
- Next system redesign will be faster

---

## Conclusion

**Design is complete. Everything is ready.**

The vault architecture is designed, documented, validated, and ready for implementation. You have:
- Clear rules for where everything goes
- Proven patterns that work
- Step-by-step execution plan
- Templates ready to use
- Success criteria to measure against

**No blockers. Start whenever ready.**

The only decisions remaining are:
1. When do you want to start Phase 3?
2. Should Personal/ folder include therapy/gender notes?
3. Where is the "Dr. Hahn outcomes" data file?

Everything else is documented and ready.
