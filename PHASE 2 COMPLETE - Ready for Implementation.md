## The Architecture (60-Second Version)

**Three systems with different rules:**

| System | What | Examples | Rule |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| **Projects** | Goal-oriented work | Cooking, PhD, arterial analysis | Single Command Center per project |
| **Knowledge** | Reusable concepts | Stability-selection, compound-engineering | Evergreen, 2+ links, proper tags |
| **Meta** | System operations | Vault Rules, Focus, templates | Version-able as system evolves |

**Key principle:** Projects ≠ Knowledge (different lifecycles)

---

## What's Ready to Execute

✓ **Templates** - All 4 Command Center templates ready (copy-paste)
✓ **Gem notes** - 5 high-value notes identified and ready to move
✓ **Inbox plan** - All ~150 remaining notes categorized
✓ **No blockers** - Everything documented, nothing missing
✓ **Timeline** - Phase 3 can complete in 3 days

---

## Phase 3 Quick Overview

**What you'll do (3 days):**
1. Create 4 Command Centers (using templates)
2. Move 5 gem notes to project homes
3. Process remaining ~150 Inbox notes

**What happens after (agents):**
- Phase 4: Dashboard enhancements (3-4 hours)
- Phase 5: Documentation updates (2-3 hours)
- Phase 6: Verification and compound (2 hours)

**Complete by:** ~2026-02-17

## Evidence It Works

**Cooking consolidation proof:**
- Before: 58 scattered notes
- After: 1 Command Center
- Result: Much better user experience
- Proves the pattern works

**Overnight analysis validation:**
- 180+ notes analyzed
- 29 notes moved with clear rationale
- 5 gems identified
- 150 remaining categorized
- Pattern shows research notes succeed, philosophy captures don't

**Architecture consistency:**
- Same Command Center structure applies to ALL 6 projects
- Proven repeatable pattern
- Templates ready for each

---

## Success Looks Like

**After Phase 3 (Target: 2026-02-12):**
- [ ] All 6 projects have Command Centers
- [ ] All gems moved to project homes
- [ ] Inbox processed

**After Phase 6 (Target: 2026-02-17):**
- [ ] 0 broken wikilinks
- [ ] <20 orphan notes
- [ ] All documentation updated
- [ ] System complete and verified

---

## Blockers / Decisions Remaining

**Minor blockers (don't stop Phase 3):**
1. Personal/ folder for sensitive notes? (you decide)
2. Find "Dr. Hahn outcomes" data file (needed for cardiac project)
3. When can you start? (only timing blocker)

**Everything else is ready.**

---

## Git Status

**Commits made:**
- db0c746: Architecture design phase 1-2 complete (5 files)
- 6a8e111: Design complete executive summary

**Total additions:** 6 files, ~14,000 words, fully committed

**All ready for handoff to Phase 3.**

---

## Next Action

**Pick one:**
- [ ] Read ARCHITECT SUMMARY (understand why this design)
- [ ] Read Vault Rules.md (understand how the system works)
- [ ] Read Focus.md (see current priorities)
- [ ] Start Phase 3 (create first Command Center)

**Recommended:** Start with ARCHITECT SUMMARY, then Vault Rules.md, then Phase 3

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can I start immediately?**
A: Yes. Phase 3 is completely ready. Templates provided, timeline clear, no blockers.

**Q: Do I have to read everything?**
A: No. Minimum: Read Vault Rules.md (20 min). Better: Add ARCHITECT SUMMARY (10 min). Best: Add Focus.md + Implementation Guide (50 min total).

**Q: What if I find issues during Phase 3?**
A: Document them in your session notes. They're expected - this is iteration. Each phase refines the design.

**Q: Can agents start without me?**
A: Yes, but recommend you read Vault Rules.md first so you understand what they're doing.

**Q: How long will this take total?**
A: Phase 3: 3 days. Phases 4-6: 1 week. Total: ~2 weeks from start to complete restructure (by ~2026-02-17).

- 6 projects with inconsistent structure
- 10-15 min to find project-specific info

**After:**
- Inbox processed and organized
- 6 projects with consistent Command Centers
- 30 seconds to find any project info
- Single Focus.md dashboard for all priorities

**System benefit:**
- Each iteration documented for next time
- Patterns reusable
- Next system redesign will be faster
- Compound Engineering loop embedded in structure

## Documentation Structure

All cross-referenced and interlinked.

## One More Thing

**This restructuring is itself a demonstration of the Compound Engineering loop:**

1. **Work** (Phases 1-2): Audit vault, analyze patterns, design system
2. **Assess** (Phases 3-5): Implement patterns, test effectiveness, refine
3. **Compound** (Phase 6): Document learnings, extract patterns, feed back
4. **Repeat**: Next vault iteration will be faster

**Each phase makes the next phase easier.**

That's the whole idea.
