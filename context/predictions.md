# Predictions for 2026-02-01 (Saturday)

Generated by overnight agent based on current context.

## Likely First Actions

1. **Review overnight work** - Check commits, this predictions file
2. **Answer pending questions** - 5 questions in [[prompts/pending]] block progress
3. **Test Obsidian integration** - After providing vault path

## Suggested Priorities

### High Value
- [ ] Answer Q-2026-01-31-02 (Obsidian vault path) - Unblocks MCP integration
- [ ] Review [[knowledge/research/]] docs created tonight - 7 new research docs
- [ ] Decide on overnight schedule (Q-2026-01-31-01)

### Medium Value
- [ ] Test graph view in Obsidian once vault is configured
- [ ] Review [[context/active-agents]] coordination setup
- [ ] Provide off-limits guidance (Q-2026-01-31-04)

## Pre-Researched Topics

Ready in knowledge/research/:
- [[knowledge/research/ai-memory-systems]] - Memory patterns for LLMs
- [[inspirations/claude-code-ecosystem]] - CC tools landscape
- [[knowledge/research/multi-agent-coordination]] - Agent coordination patterns
- [[knowledge/research/task-automation-scheduling]] - Scheduling options
- [[knowledge/research/recursive-self-improvement]] - Self-improvement patterns
- [[knowledge/research/proactive-assistant-patterns]] - Proactive AI research
- [[knowledge/research/pkm-mcp-servers]] - PKM MCP comparison

## Blocked Work

| Task | Blocked By | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Obsidian MCP setup | Q-02 vault path | Can't test locally |
| Scheduled overnight runs | Q-01 schedule | Manual runs only |
| Error handling design | Q-03 notification preference | Using logs for now |

## Questions I Might Ask You

- Would you like me to set up the Obsidian MCP server?
- Should I continue converting files to Obsidian format?
- Any research topics to prioritize?
- Review any of the overnight commits?

## Session Context

- Weekend day - might have more time for setup
- 5 pending questions need answers
- Brain system infrastructure largely complete
- Ready for MCP integrations once paths confirmed

## Confidence

- High: You'll review overnight work
- Medium: You'll answer some pending questions
- Low: Full Obsidian setup in one session

## System Predictions (claude-code-web)

### P-2026-01-31-01: First Overnight Test Needed

**Type:** near-term
**Confidence:** high (90%)
**Based on:** System setup complete, overnight runner created, but never tested on actual hardware
**Action:** Prepare test checklist for overnight runner validation
**Validate by:** User runs overnight-brain.sh or overnight-brain.ps1 successfully

### P-2026-01-31-02: User Questions Will Block Progress

**Type:** immediate
**Confidence:** high (95%)
**Based on:** 5 questions in [[prompts/pending]] without answers
**Action:** Highlight questions Q-01, Q-02, Q-05 as blocking automation setup
**Validate by:** User answers questions in prompts/answered.md

### P-2026-01-31-03: Graph View Testing Needed

**Type:** near-term
**Confidence:** medium (70%)
**Based on:** Obsidian config created, all files have frontmatter, but graph untested
**Action:** User opens brain repo in Obsidian, checks graph view connectivity
**Validate by:** User confirms graph view shows connected nodes

## Prediction Validation

After each prediction:
1. Was it useful? (Y/N)
2. Was timing right? (Early/Right/Late)
3. What would have been better?

Record in `experiments/results/` to improve prediction accuracy.

## Patterns to Track

| Pattern | Indicators | Prediction |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Work rhythm | Daily note timestamps, activity | When focused work happens |
| Project attention | Link frequency, mentions | Which project needs focus |
| Task completion | Checkbox patterns | What actually gets done |
| Context switching | Topic jumps in notes | Energy/focus transitions |
| Blockers | Repeated mentions without resolution | What's stuck |

*Predictions are hypotheses. Track accuracy, iterate, improve.*
