# Predictions for 2026-02-01 (Saturday)

Generated by overnight agent based on current context.

## Likely First Actions

1. **Review overnight work** - Check commits, this predictions file
2. **Answer pending questions** - 5 questions in [[prompts/pending]] block progress
3. **Test Obsidian integration** - After providing vault path

## Suggested Priorities

### High Value
- [ ] Answer Q-2026-01-31-02 (Obsidian vault path) - Unblocks MCP integration
- [ ] Review [[knowledge/research/]] docs created tonight - 7 new research docs
- [ ] Decide on overnight schedule (Q-2026-01-31-01)

### Medium Value  
- [ ] Test graph view in Obsidian once vault is configured
- [ ] Review [[context/active-agents]] coordination setup
- [ ] Provide off-limits guidance (Q-2026-01-31-04)

## Pre-Researched Topics

Ready in knowledge/research/:
- [[knowledge/research/ai-memory-systems]] - Memory patterns for LLMs
- [[knowledge/research/claude-code-ecosystem]] - CC tools landscape
- [[knowledge/research/multi-agent-coordination]] - Agent coordination patterns
- [[knowledge/research/task-automation-scheduling]] - Scheduling options
- [[knowledge/research/recursive-self-improvement]] - Self-improvement patterns
- [[knowledge/research/proactive-assistant-patterns]] - Proactive AI research
- [[knowledge/research/obsidian-mcp-options]] - MCP server comparison

## Blocked Work

| Task | Blocked By | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Obsidian MCP setup | Q-02 vault path | Can't test locally |
| Scheduled overnight runs | Q-01 schedule | Manual runs only |
| Error handling design | Q-03 notification preference | Using logs for now |

## Questions I Might Ask You

- Would you like me to set up the Obsidian MCP server?
- Should I continue converting files to Obsidian format?
- Any research topics to prioritize?
- Review any of the overnight commits?

## Session Context

- Weekend day - might have more time for setup
- 5 pending questions need answers
- Brain system infrastructure largely complete
- Ready for MCP integrations once paths confirmed

## Confidence

- High: You'll review overnight work
- Medium: You'll answer some pending questions
- Low: Full Obsidian setup in one session
