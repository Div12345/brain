# Session Handoff

> Context for Claude to read at session start. Updated end of each session.

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-02
**Last Session:** Building personal AI hub system with scientific experiment approach

## Current Focus

### Primary: arterial_analysis
- Long-running PhD project (bioengineering)
- ML methodology questions persist: nested CV, stability selection, small dataset approaches
- Recent work: literature review on feature selection in low-N high-P settings
- Papers being analyzed: Meinshausen 2009 (Stability Selection), Nouraie 2025, Cawley 2010 (overfitting in model selection)

### Secondary: Brain System (this repo)
- Building self-recursive AI assistant
- Tonight: Created scientific experiment plan with 4 hypotheses
- Goal: Context persistence, pattern recognition, workflow automation

---

## Core Principles (DO NOT VIOLATE)

1. **Minimal viable structure** - Start simple, add only when pain demonstrated
2. **Match my brain** - Use existing patterns (`!` priorities, `[[wikilinks]]`), don't force new habits
3. **Low friction above all** - If it feels like work, the system has failed
4. **Safety enables aggression** - Clear boundaries → move fast within them
5. **Append-only preferred** - Add knowledge, don't overwrite; git is sacred
6. **Ask, don't assume** - Generate questions rather than guess at intent
7. **Be ready before asked** - Prepare resources, surface at right moment

## Active Patterns (From Vault Analysis)

| Pattern | Trigger | What to Do |
|---------|---------|------------|
| ML methodology question | "nested CV", "stability selection", "feature selection" | Surface literature notes, offer to search Zotero |
| Deep work session | Late night (after 10pm), long session | Don't interrupt, batch suggestions for later |
| Paper analysis | Mention of paper, author, methodology | Check if in Zotero, offer literature note template |
| Task capture | `!`, `!!`, `!!!` markers | Respect priority system, don't suggest alternatives |
| Project work | `[[arterial_analysis]]` | Know this is primary PhD work |

## Open Questions (Help Me With These)

### ML Methodology (Genuine Uncertainty)
- How to properly do nested CV with stability selection?
- What's the right approach for n=50, p=200 settings?
- How to balance interpretability vs. predictive performance?

### Brain System (Being Built)
- Will context injection actually reduce session startup time?
- What patterns are worth storing in skill library?
- How to measure "usefulness" of surfaced patterns?

## Skill Triggers

| When I Say | You Should |
|------------|------------|
| "working on arterial" | Load arterial_analysis context, recent decisions |
| "paper", "literature" | Offer Zotero search, literature note workflow |
| "debug", "not working" | Enter debug workflow: reproduce → isolate → fix → verify |
| "admin", "need to" | Batch similar tasks, offer admin workflow |
| "build", "create", "implement" | Check for existing patterns in skills library first |

---

## Recent Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-02 | Scientific experiment approach | User wants hypothesis-driven, measurable progress |
| 2026-02-02 | Use existing tools only | Already have CLAUDE.md, omc, file-based state - add nothing |
| 2026-02-02 | 4-file bootstrap | session-handoff.md, skills/, execution log, metrics |
| 2026-02-02 | Daily/sooner feedback cycles | Not weekly - need fast iteration |

## What Worked / What Didn't (Last Session)

### Worked
- Deep research with parallel scientist agents (5 stages)
- Vault analysis revealing actual usage patterns
- Extracting core principles from existing docs

### Didn't Work
- First plan was too passive (read notes, generate focus list)
- Ralplan iteration 1 failed critic review (didn't deliver immediate value)
- Asking same questions repeatedly instead of using gathered context

### Lesson
Read this file first. Don't ask what I'm working on - you know.

## Experiment Status

### E1: Context Persistence (ACTIVE)
- Hypothesis: Context injection reduces time-to-first-useful-output
- Status: Bootstrap created, testing tomorrow
- Measure: TTFUO with/without injection

### E2-E4: Pending E1 results
