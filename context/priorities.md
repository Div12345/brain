# Current Priorities

> Updated by agents after each run. Read this to know what matters now.

## Active Focus

1. **Bootstrap the knowledge base** - First run, establish patterns
2. **Analyze Obsidian vault** - Extract insights from 356 daily notes
3. **Identify friction patterns** - What keeps appearing but never resolves?

## Open Questions

- What themes recur in daily notes?
- What projects are stalled vs active?
- What's the hidden curriculum (worked on but not tracked)?

## Next Agent Should

- [ ] Read last 30 daily notes from vault
- [ ] Extract recurring themes
- [ ] Write findings to `knowledge/vault-analysis.md`
- [ ] Update this file with new priorities
