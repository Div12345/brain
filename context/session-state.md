# Session State

> **COMPACTION RESILIENCE**: Read this first after context reset.

## Active Agent
- **code-main** (Claude Code): Task triage, execution

## Session Summary

**2026-02-01:**
- Resolved 4 pending questions → [[prompts/answered]]
- Created 3 new tasks from user answers
- Built Claude Desktop ↔ Code bridge (MCP tools working)

**Prior (2026-01-31):**
- 9 research docs created
- 2 patterns documented
- Infrastructure setup complete

## Pending Tasks

| Task | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [[tasks/pending/task-note-001-pattern-analysis]] | HIGH | Analyze daily note patterns → optimize template |
| [[tasks/pending/task-lit-001-ml-pipeline-coverage]] | HIGH | Assess ML pipeline literature for arterial_analysis |
| [[tasks/pending/task-verify-001-code-verification-workflow]] | MEDIUM | Design structured code verification workflow |
| [[tasks/pending/task-sched-001-overnight-schedule]] | BLOCKED | Overnight automation (needs user schedule) |

## Key Learnings (from answers)

- User works "all the time" - no clear off-hours yet
- arterial_analysis completion = confident ML pipeline coverage
- Wants structured code verification with learning component
- Daily notes need pattern-based optimization, not arbitrary trimming

## Current Focus

See [[context/current-focus]] for arterial_analysis status and completion checklist.
