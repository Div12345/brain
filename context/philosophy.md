# User Philosophy & Patterns

> Extracted from vault meta-documentation. All agents should embody these principles.

## Core Philosophy

| Principle | What It Means | Agent Implication |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Minimal viable structure** | Start simple, add complexity only when pain points emerge | Don't over-engineer outputs |
| **Match your brain** | Use patterns already present, don't force new habits | Learn existing tags, formats, rhythms |
| **Low friction** | If it feels like work, the system has failed | Outputs should slot into existing flow |
| **Iterate based on use** | Version 1.0 mindset. Adjust based on what helps | Propose small changes, not redesigns |

## Behavioral Patterns

### How You Think About Tasks

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Energy states** | Reflective mood ≠ productive action-taking mindset |
| **Time windows** | Frame work as "shouldn't take more than a few hours" |
| **Urgency vs eventually** | Some have hard deadlines, others float |
| **Context switching cost** | Research vs admin vs personal need different headspaces |
| **Blocking factors** | Weather, waiting on others, need to call someone |

### Task Capture Patterns

Natural task formats:
- Narrative text: "I want to make amazon returns before I buy anything more"
- Bracket notation: `[!credit card closing]` or `[yoga]`
- Highlighted urgency: `==tracker==` with `!!!!!!!!!`
- Numbered lists with sub-tasks
- Mixed with reflective writing

## Existing Systems That Work

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Daily note template | Working |
| Priority markers `!` `!!` `!!!` | Working |
| `[[wikilinks]]` | Working |
| Zotero integration | Working |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Suggest emoji-based systems | Explicitly rejected |
| Propose complex date syntax | Adds cognitive load |
| Create overwhelming dashboards | Low friction principle |
| Add many new habits/routines | Avoid draining spirals |
| Ignore existing working systems | Match your brain |

## Success Metrics

A good recommendation should:
1. Use existing patterns (exclamation marks, wikilinks, current folders)
2. Require zero new habits to maintain
3. Be testable in one day
4. Fail gracefully if ignored
