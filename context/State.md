# Current State (DEPRECATED)

> **⚠️ This file is deprecated.** The source of truth is now `[[00 - Dashboard/State.md]]` in OneVault.
> Per [[99 - Meta/System/CE Staging Rules]], brain repo context/ files are historical records, not live state.
>
> **Read OneVault State.md instead via Obsidian MCP.**

## Focus

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Active project** | brain-system / workflow-framework |
| **CE stage** | brainstorm |
| **Active file** | [[docs/brainstorms/2026-02-05-unified-workflow-framework-brainstorm]] |

## Recent Decisions

| Date | Decision | Confidence |
|------|----------|------------|
| 2026-02-05 | Brain repo = CE system home, OneVault = personal | high |
| 2026-02-05 | State.md as cross-interface bridge | high |
| 2026-02-05 | Session persistence before overnight fixes | high |
| 2026-02-05 | Kanban + dataview in brain vault | medium |

## Blocked

- [ ] Vault architecture final decision (merge vs separate)
- [ ] Arterial analysis code location (need to find path)

## Next Actions

- [ ] Finalize vault architecture decision
- [ ] Create session-note template
- [ ] Configure kanban in brain vault
- [ ] Test one real CE loop (arterial code review or cardiac plan)

## Last Sessions

| Date | Interface | Topic | Outcome File |
|------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| 2026-02-05 23:45 | CC | Workflow framework | [[docs/brainstorms/2026-02-05-unified-workflow-framework-brainstorm]] |
| 2026-02-05 22:00 | Desktop | Workflow framework | (conversation, not persisted) |
