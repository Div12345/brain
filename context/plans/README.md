# Plans

Drop plans here. Claude Code executes them.

## Format

```markdown
# Plan: [Name]

## Goal
What you want done.

## Tasks
1. Task one
2. Task two
3. Task three

## Notes
Any constraints or preferences.
```

That's it. Keep it simple.

## How It Works

1. **You + Claude Desktop** → iterate on idea → save plan here
2. **Claude Code** → reads plan → creates tasks → executes
3. **Results** → appear in `tasks/completed/` and `logs/`

## Current Plans

(empty - add plans as .md files)
