# Tooling & Workflow Improvements

## From Daily Notes (Jan 28 – Feb 5)

### Zotero Integration
- Zotero → Obsidian template: don't like current naming on pull (citekey)
- Need better templates — look at "notetaking for historians" or community templates
- Line-level linking in Zotero for citations matched to papers

### Paper Search MCP
- Web of Science starter API — add to paper-search?
- Cookie capture for NotebookLM MCP needs improvement
- Need skills or scripted workflows for paper discovery

### Obsidian Vault
- Wants to clean up vault, possibly from scratch
- Doesn't trust AI for notetaking/synthesis — wants own synthesis, AI for reports
- Project progress logging: rethink single-page approach, split across pages
- `%%ai-*%%` tag search for continue points between sessions

### Workflow Gaps
- Lit review → coding pipeline needs cleaner flow
- Want to demonstrate and record workflows
- Git exploration / codebase mapping tools (MCP/plugin)
- Activity Watch data — can it be put to use?

## Quick Wins vs Bigger Projects
- Quick: Zotero template fix, paper-search WoS API
- Medium: Vault cleanup strategy, workflow recording
- Bigger: Full lit-review-to-code pipeline
