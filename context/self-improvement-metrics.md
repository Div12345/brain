# Self-Improvement Metrics

## Task Performance

| Task Type | Attempts | Success | Rate | Notes |
|-----------|----------|---------|------|-------|
| Research docs | 5 | 5 | 100% | ai-memory, cc-ecosystem, coordination, scheduling, self-improvement |
| File conversion | 8 | 8 | 100% | Obsidian format migrations |
| Task creation | 3 | 3 | 100% | cc-001, sched-001, obs-001 |
| Coordination | 3 | 3 | 100% | session-state, active-agents, handoff |

## Session: 2026-01-31 Overnight

### What Worked
- Blackboard coordination via GitHub commits
- Session-state for compaction resilience
- Parallel work with other agent (didn't conflict)
- Research → knowledge doc → commit cycle

### What Didn't
- N/A (first full session)

### Patterns Identified
1. **Commit-as-broadcast**: Commit messages signal work to other agents
2. **File-level locking**: Work on different files to avoid conflicts
3. **State file recovery**: session-state.md enables compaction survival

### Improvements Made
- Created [[context/active-agents]] for coordination
- Added [[knowledge/research/multi-agent-coordination]] patterns
- Built self-improvement infrastructure (this file)

### Open Questions
- Optimal commit frequency?
- How to handle merge conflicts between agents?
- When to use sequential-thinking vs direct action?

## Skill Effectiveness

| Skill | Uses | Issues | Refinements Needed |
|-------|------|--------|-------------------|
| brain-system | 1 | None yet | TBD after more use |

## Meta-Metrics
